        <p>When Im not coding you can usually find me playing videogames, trying to draw something, reading a book or
        just hanging out at the gym. Im always striving to learn something new in this wast world of technologu and coding
        and up my skills.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Ever since I started my coding adventure about 2 years ago I've been in love with the front end of things, creating everything
        that the user can see and making the user having the best user experience that they can have. Reccently I've been trying out some
        coding in C# and Unity by making my own games and really been loving every moment of it. The dream is to make a really awesome game 
        in the future that people can enjoy!</p>
